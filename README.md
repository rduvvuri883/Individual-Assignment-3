# Individual-Assignment-3

In this hands-on lab, we will learn how to use Apache Spark on Cloud Dataproc to distribute a computationally intensive image processing task onto a cluster of machines. This lab is part of a series of labs on processing scientific data.

Key Learnings Include:

How to create a managed Cloud Dataproc cluster with Apache Spark pre-installed.

How to build and run jobs that use external packages that aren't already installed on the cluster.

How to shut down the cluster.
